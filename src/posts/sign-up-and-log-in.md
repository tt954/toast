# Signing Up and Logging In

The signup and login pages are often the very first interaction a user has with your application or website. As such, they serve as a gateway into your application. A well-designed flow of elements should guide the user effortlessly from start to finish. Follow along as I learn about the details of making a good signup/login page.

## User Experience (UX) Considerations

Creating a positive first impression is key. Here are some UX principles to keep in mind when designing your signup and login pages:

- **Autofocus on the primary input field** Save your users a click by automatically focusing on the field they are most likely to interact with first. For a login page, this is usually the email or username field.
- **Leverage specialized mobile keyboards** Semantic HTML can significantly improve the mobile experience. By setting the correct type attribute for input fields (e.g., `type="email"` for email addresses, `type="tel"` for phone numbers, `type="password"` for passwords), you trigger the display of optimized keyboards with relevant characters, making data entry faster and easier for mobile users.
- **Provide immediate validation feedback** Validate input fields as soon as the user moves away from them (on "blur"). Clearly indicate any errors inline, guiding users to correct mistakes in real-time rather than waiting for a submission attempt.
- **Use clear and descriptive button labels** Instead of generic labels like "Continue" or "Submit," use action-oriented text that clearly communicates the button's purpose. Examples include "Create account," "Log in," or "Sign up."
- **Offer easy switching between signup and login** Provide a prominent link or clear visual cue that allows users to easily navigate between the signup and login forms. For example, "Already have an account? Log in" on the signup page, and "New to our platform? Sign up" on the login page.
- **Remember user emails on failed login attempts** If a login attempt fails due to an incorrect password, pre-populate the email or username field on the next attempt. This saves the user from re-entering information you already know
- **Display informative and helpful error messages** When a user enters invalid information (e.g., incorrect email format, wrong password), provide specific and understandable error messages that explain why the input is invalid and how to fix it. Avoid generic error messages like "Invalid credentials."

Here are some additional enhancements that can further improve the user experience:

- Make labels clickable: Associating labels with their corresponding input fields (using the `<label for>` attribute) not only improves accessibility but also increases the clickable area, making it easier for users to focus on the input.
- Offer a "Show/hide password" option: This simple feature enhances security and reduces frustration by allowing users to verify they have typed their password correctly.
- Implement a "Remember me" option: For returning users, a "Remember me" checkbox can save them the hassle of logging in on each visit (use with caution and consider security implications).
- Include a "Forgot your password?" link: Provide a clear and easily accessible link for users who have forgotten their passwords, guiding them through the password recovery process.
- Consider social login or magic links: Offering single sign-on (SSO) options (e.g., "Continue with Google," "Log in with Facebook") or passwordless magic links can streamline the login process significantly.
- Reconsider requiring explicit agreement for terms and privacy (where legally permissible): In some regions, explicit consent for terms and privacy policies is legally required. However, if not mandated, you can often include a non-intrusive message like "By signing up, you agree to our [Terms of Service] and [Privacy Policy]" below the signup form, saving users an extra click.

## Implementation: The Technical Underpinnings

The signup and login pages serve distinct but related purposes:

### Creating a New User (Sign Up)

The primary goal of the signup process is to register a new user within your system. This involves:

- **Collecting identifying information** The user provides necessary details, which typically include an email address and a password, but can also extend to a username, name, or other relevant information depending on your application's needs.
- **Storing user data** This information is securely stored in a database.
- **Securely handling passwords** Never store passwords in plaintext. Instead, use hashing algorithms (like bcrypt or Argon2) with salt to securely store password representations. This protects user credentials even in the event of a data breach. You should also implement measures to encourage or enforce password strength (e.g., minimum length, inclusion of different character types, password strength meter).
- **Creating a digital identity** Upon successful signup, a unique identifier is created for the user within your system, representing their digital identity for future interactions.
- **Potentially verifying the user's email** Many applications implement email verification to ensure the provided email address is valid and belongs to the user. This often involves sending a verification link to the user's email address.

### Verifying a User (Log In)

The purpose of the login process is to verify the identity of a returning user and grant them access to your application. This involves:

- **Receiving user credentials** The user provides their identifying information, typically email/username and password.
- **Authenticating the user** Compare provided credentials against the stored user data. Retrieve the hashed password associated with the given email/username and comparing it with the hashed password entered by the user. If the hashes match (after applying the same salt and hashing algorithm), the user is considered authenticated.

### Managing a User Session

Once a user is successfully logged in, you need a mechanism to track their authenticated state across multiple requests. This is typically achieved through session management:

- **Creating a session** Upon signup or successful login, generate a unique session token that is associated with an active session (indicating this user authenticated). Make sure to set an expiration date (usually 30 days).
- **Storing session data** Information about the user's current session (e.g., user ID, login timestamp) is stored, often on the server-side (e.g., in memory, a database, or a dedicated session store like Redis).
- **Using cookies (or other mechanisms)** A session cookie containing the unique session identifier is sent to the user's browser. On subsequent requests, the browser sends this cookie back to the server. The server uses this cookie to retrieve the corresponding session data and identify the logged-in user. Other mechanisms for session management include using local storage or passing session tokens in request headers.
- **Validating a session token** Does it still exist in the database and it it still within expiration? Extend the session expiration date when it's close to expiration to ensure active sessions are persisted while inactive ones will eventually expire.

### Giving User Access to Protected Resources (Authorization)

Once a user is authenticated and a session is established, the next step is authorization: determining what resources and actions the authenticated user is allowed to access. This involves:

- **Defining user roles and permissions** You define different roles within your application and associate specific permissions with each role.
- **Checking user permissions** On each request for a protected resource or action, your application checks the logged-in user's role and the required permissions to determine if access should be granted.
  - Optimistic check using the session token stored in the cookie
  - Secure check usin the session data stored in the database

By focusing on both the user experience and the underlying implementation details, you can create signup and login pages that are not only functional but also user-friendly and secure. With all of that being said, there is so much more to learn about the Authentication and Authorization process, but I will stop here (for now).
